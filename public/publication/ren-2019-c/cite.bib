 abstract = {Arising in a large number of application areas, sparse recovery (SR) has been exhaustively investigated and many algorithms have been proposed. Different from the numerical methods realized by iterative algorithm, the recent continuous approach is realized through analog circuit, which takes advantage of short time-delay and fast convergence. However, the existing continuous method for SR still has the space to further improve the convergence speed. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new dynamical continuous system to solve the sparse signal recovery problem with fixed-time convergence property.},
