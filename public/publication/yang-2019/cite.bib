 abstract = {Event camera is bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes asynchronously. Compared to the conventional frame-based camera, it is with high dynamic range, low latency and high sensitivity, and thus can be exploited in SLAM to tackle the problem of occasions with high-speed camera moving and low-light scenes. In this demo, we implement the visual-inerial SLAM in real time with the recently released event camera, namely, CeleX-V. With the feature of high spatial resolution (1280×800) and low latency (\textless 0.5µs), the proposed method can provide frames with abundant textures and high time response, which leads to more stable tracking ability and better performance in SLAM system.},
