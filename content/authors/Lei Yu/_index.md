余磊 is currently a full Professor of the [School of Electronic and Information](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/) and leading a group [DVS-WHU](http://dvs-whu.cn/) in the [SPLab](http://dsp.whu.edu.cn) which is devoted for [event-based perception](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/event-based_vision_resources). In general his research interest includes signal processing, deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, he is currently interested in:

- Sparse Signal Recovery
- Neuromorphic Computation
- Event-based Image Enhancement and Visual Perception

Previously, he received the Bachelor and PhD degrees in Signal and Information Processing in 2006 and 2012, respectively, both from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/). He also got a PhD degree in Automatic Control from [ENSEA](http://www.ensea.fr/)/[Université de Cergy-Pontoise](http://www.u-cergy.fr/index.php), Cergy, France, in November 2011. From December 2011 to March 2013, He held a Postdoctoral position in Empenn (former name: ViSaGe), working with [Prof. Rémi Gribonval](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/remi.gribonval/) and [Prof. Christian Barillot](http://people.irisa.fr/Christian.Barillot/).
