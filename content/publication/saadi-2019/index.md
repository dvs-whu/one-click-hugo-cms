abstract: It is well-known that observer design is a powerful tool to estimate the
  states of a dynamical system. Given a multi-output nonlinear dynamical system whose
  states are partially observable, this paper investigates the problem of observer
  design to estimate those observable states. It considers firstly a nonlinear system
  without inputs, and provides a set of geometric conditions, guaranteeing the existence
  of a change of coordinates which splits the studied nonlinear dynamical system into
  two subsystems, where one of them is of the well-known nonlinear observer normal
  form, for which a Luenberger-like observer can be designed. An extension to nonlinear
  systems with inputs has then been deduced.
