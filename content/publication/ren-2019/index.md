abstract: The sparse recovery (SR) algorithm, under the premise that signals are sparse,
  can be divided into two categories. One is a digital discrete method implemented
  via lots of iterative computations and the other is a continuous method implemented
  via analog circuits, which is usually faster. In this paper, we focus on the continuous
  method and propose a fixed-time convergence dynamical system. Compared with the
  existing system, it dynamically allocates the exponent according to time-varying
  elements of the system state, avoiding possible mismatches between the fixed exponent
  and some elements.
