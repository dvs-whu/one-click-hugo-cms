abstract: Arising in a large number of application areas, sparse recovery (SR) has
  been exhaustively investigated and many algorithms have been proposed. Different
  from the numerical methods realized by iterative algorithm, the recent continuous
  approach is realized through analog circuit, which takes advantage of short time-delay
  and fast convergence. However, the existing continuous method for SR still has the
  space to further improve the convergence speed. Consequently, in this paper, we
  propose a new dynamical continuous system to solve the sparse signal recovery problem
  with fixed-time convergence property.
