abstract: The nuclear norm minimization method emerged from a patch-based low-rank
  model leads to an excellent image denoising performance, where the non-local self-similarity
  over image patches is exploited. However, natural images are normally with complex
  and irregular image patches, which cannot be well represented using only a low-rank
  model, and thus most of them suffer from the over-penalty problem especially for
  images with lots of local irregular structures (e.g., fine details or sharp edges),
  and then results in over-smoothing problem after denoising. On the other hand, in
  order to represent the irregular components, edges defined over pixel level are
  often exploited. While the total variation (TV) is a well-known prior to remove
  noises and preserve edges, it might yield undesired staircase artifacts. The total
  generalized variation (TGV), a generalization of TV, can largely alleviate such
  staircase artifacts. Consequently, in order to deal with the over-smoothing problem
  aroused by a low-rank model, we propose a re-weighted TGV regularized nuclear norm
  minimization model for local structure preserving image denoising. Thanks to the
  split Bregman method, our proposed model can be effectively solved. A re-weighted
  strategy is developed to adaptively update the weight parameters of TGV regularization.
  The encouraging experimental results on noisy images demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.
