abstract: This paper considers the problem of recovering sparse signals with cluster
  structure of unknown sizes and locations. A hybrid prior is proposed by introducing
  a local continuity indicator, which adaptively imposes cluster information on the
  sparse coefficients according to the inherent data structure. The local continuity
  indicator flexibly switches the prior for a sparse coefficient between a fully pattern-coupled
  one and an independent one, so that the estimation of the sparse coefficient can
  selectively use the statistical information of its neighbors. Variational Bayesian
  inference is used to estimate the hidden variables based on the constructed probabilistic
  modeling. Numerical results of comprehensive simulations and real data experiments
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid the problem of structural
  mismatch and outperform other recently reported clustered sparse signal recovery
  algorithms in noisy environments.
