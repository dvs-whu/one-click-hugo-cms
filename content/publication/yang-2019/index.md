abstract: Event camera is bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness
  changes asynchronously. Compared to the conventional frame-based camera, it is with
  high dynamic range, low latency and high sensitivity, and thus can be exploited
  in SLAM to tackle the problem of occasions with high-speed camera moving and low-light
  scenes. In this demo, we implement the visual-inerial SLAM in real time with the
  recently released event camera, namely, CeleX-V. With the feature of high spatial
  resolution (1280×800) and low latency (textless 0.5µs), the proposed method can
  provide frames with abundant textures and high time response, which leads to more
  stable tracking ability and better performance in SLAM system.
