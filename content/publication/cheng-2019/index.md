title: "DET: A High-Resolution DVS Dataset for Lane Extraction"
abstract: Lane extraction is a basic yet necessary task for autonomous driving.
  Although past years have witnessed major advances in lane extraction with deep
  learning models, they all aim at ordinary RGB images generated by frame-based
  cameras, which limits their performance in nature. To tackle this problem, we
  introduce Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), a type of event-based sensor to lane
  extraction task and build a high-resolution DVS dataset for lane extraction
  (DET). We collect the raw event data and generate 5,424 event-based sensor
  images with a resolution of 1280×800, the highest one among all DVS datasets
  available now. These images include complex trafﬁc scenes and various lane
  types. All images of DET are annotated with multi-class segmentation format.
  The fully annotated DET images contains 17,103 lane instances, each of which
  is labeled pixel by pixel manually. We evaluate state-of-the-art lane
  extraction models on DET to build a benchmark for lane extraction task with
  event-based sensor images. Experimental results demonstrate that DET is quite
  challenging for even state-of-the-art lane extraction methods. DET is made
  publicly available, including the raw event data, accumulated images and
  labels1.
